# Student Management System

## Description
The Student Management System is a Java application designed to provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing student records.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The core programming language used for developing the application. Download and install Java from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
- **JavaFX**: The JavaFX framework is utilized for building the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application.
  - **SDK**: Download the JavaFX SDK from [Gluon](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).
  - **JDK**: Ensure that you have the appropriate JDK version that supports JavaFX. Download from [Azul](https://www.azul.com/downloads/).
- **SQLite JDBC Driver**: The JDBC driver for SQLite database management system. This enables Java applications to interact with SQLite databases.
  - Download the driver from [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.xerial/sqlite-jdbc).
- **NetBeans**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for developing and managing the project.
  - Download NetBeans from [Apache NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/).
